## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Cthulhu's Setup Script, we take security seriously. If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities, please report them to us immediately 
so we can address them promptly.

# How to Report a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

  1. Create an Issue: Go to the Issues tab of this repository and create a new issue.
  2. Issue Title: Use a clear and descriptive title that summarizes the vulnerability.
  3. Description: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce if possible.
  4. Affected Versions: Specify which versions of the project are affected by the vulnerability.
  5. Additional Information: Include any additional information that might be helpful, such as potential impact or suggested mitigations.

# Response Process

Once we receive a security vulnerability report, we will respond promptly to acknowledge receipt and begin investigating the issue. We will keep you informed 
of our progress and let you know when we have a resolution.

# Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy for security vulnerabilities. We ask that you please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a 
chance to address it. Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will work with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline.


# Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability in our project, we ask that you:

  1. Refrain from exploiting the vulnerability for any purpose other than to demonstrate its existence.
  2. Avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it.
  3. Provide us with reasonable time to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.

# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the individuals and organizations who have responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities to us in the past. 
Your contributions help us improve the security of our project for everyone.
